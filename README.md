ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I am an experienced python/django & node/typescript fullstack engineer. In a quest to become a better programmer I have started on a journey to add other languages and skills to my toolbox. You can follow my journey on [My Site](https://richkevan.com)

I have done a little with Swift, but not deep dived into like my current learning journey. This is my first commit of my deep dive to learn this language and add it to my skillset.

In addition to Swift I am also going to be refreshing/broadening my knowledge of
1. Node/Typescript
2. Python/Django
3. Php/Laravel 

Along this journey I will also be devoting time to picking up
1. C#
2. Go
3. Flutter
4. Ruby
5. Swift

I am also in conjuction with the projects I build going to use every opportunity to brushup on the complimentary technologies.
1. SQL(PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. NoSQL(MongoDB)
3. Redis
4. Docker
5. Kubernetes

I hope you will follow me adventures and cheer me on along the way
